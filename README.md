# ðŸ§¾ Sales Data Analytics Dashboard (BigQuery)

## Project Overview
This project uses **Google BigQuery** to clean and prepare a sales dataset covering **Jan 1, 2019 through January 1, 2020** for visualization in **Google Looker Studio**.  
The dataset captures seven months of transaction activity across major U.S. cities, allowing trend analysis of sales, margins, and product performance leading into the new year.

Note: The dataset is large, so initial loading may take extra time. To improve performance, the default date range has been narrowed. You can adjust it using the date range picker on the dashboard.---
