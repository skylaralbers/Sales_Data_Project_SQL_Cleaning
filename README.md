# ðŸ§¾ Sales Data Analytics Dashboard

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project transforms a raw sales export into a clean, analysis-ready dataset and visualizes it using **Google Looker Studio**.  
The goal is to simplify raw data into structured metrics that highlight product performance, sales trends, and profit margins across different U.S. cities.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning and Enrichment

### 1. Source Data
**Files:** Contained within the ZIP archive `sales_data_project.zip`

- `sales_data.csv` â€“ raw export  
- `sales_data post sql clean.csv` â€“ cleaned and formatted dataset  

Raw data included:
- Combined date-time strings  
- Single-line address fields  
- Untyped numeric values  

### 2. Cleaning and Transformation
**File:** `Sales_Data.sql`  
Executed in **Google BigQuery** to create the cleaned dataset.

| Transformation | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `Order_Date_Clean` | Extracted date only from timestamp (e.g., `"1/22/2019 21:25"` â†’ `"2019-01-22"`) |
| `City` | Extracted from `Purchase_Address` (e.g., `"944 Walnut St, Boston, MA 02215"` â†’ `"Boston"`) |
| `Purchase_State` | Parsed from `Purchase_Address` (e.g., `"MA"`) |
| `Quantity_Ordered`, `Price_Each` | Converted from text to numeric values for analysis |
| `cost_price`, `turnover`, `margin` | Derived using a temporary cost factor map per product |
| `*_usd` fields | Added formatted USD versions of key numeric columns for dashboard display |

All transformations follow **BigQuery StandardSQL** and are documented in the `.sql` file.

## ðŸ§® Example SQL Snippet and Explanation
The following SQL block demonstrates the **core logic** used to calculate cost, turnover, and profit margin for each transaction.  
Each expression converts text-based fields to numeric, applies cost factors, and standardizes values for dashboard use.

```sql
-- Calculate estimated product cost using a mapped cost factor
ROUND(
  b.Price_Each * b.Quantity_Ordered * COALESCE(c.cost_factor, 1.00),
  4
) AS cost_price,

-- Compute total sales revenue before costs
ROUND(
  b.Price_Each * b.Quantity_Ordered,
  2
) AS turnover,

-- Derive margin as the difference between revenue and estimated cost
ROUND(
  (b.Price_Each * b.Quantity_Ordered)
  - (b.Price_Each * b.Quantity_Ordered * COALESCE(c.cost_factor, 1.00)),
  4
) AS margin
